# 🔐 Multi-Cipher Encryption Tool

## 🌟 Overview

The **Multi-Cipher Encryption Tool** is a C++ console-based application that provides users with multiple classical encryption and decryption algorithms. This project was developed as part of a university-level cryptography assignment to demonstrate the implementation of common cipher techniques used in historical and educational cryptography.

Users can choose from a set of six ciphers, perform encryption and decryption operations, and understand the transformation of plaintext into ciphertext through various methodologies.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Caesar Cipher 🔁**  
  Shift each letter in the text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

- **Substitution Cipher 🔄**  
  Substitute each character with another based on a key.

- **Playfair Cipher 🔡**  
  Encrypt digraphs using a 5x5 matrix based on a keyword.

- **Hill Cipher 🧮**  
  Uses linear algebra and matrix multiplication for encryption.

- **Vigenère Cipher 🔑**  
  A polyalphabetic cipher using a keyword for multiple Caesar shifts.

- **Transposition Cipher 🔃**  
  Rearranges the characters of the plaintext based on a key order.

## 📋 Usage

When you run the program, a menu allows you to select one of the cipher options. Depending on the method chosen, you will be asked for:

- **Plaintext input**
- **Key** (numeric or string)

The program then performs **encryption** and, where applicable, **decryption**.
